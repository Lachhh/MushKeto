"678","JOKE_0_NO_MTX","Ah ok, phew! I thought so!","Ah ok, ouf! Quand même, faut pas charrier!"
"679","JOKE_1_MTX","I mean, that's a ludicrous amount of money to pay for a virtual item, you still wanna buy that?","Tu sais, c'est une somme ridicule à payer pour quelque chose de virtuel, veux-tu VRAIMENT acheter ça?"
"680","JOKE_2_MTX","You'll probably need to get another job, a loan, sell all of your belongings... Are you sure?","Tu auras surement besoin de trouver un emploi de plus, prendre un prêt, vendre la totalité de tes biens... Es-tu sûr?"
"681","JOKE_3_MTX","That's kind of excessive don't you think? Don't you want to cancel now?","C'est un peu excessif tu ne trouve pas? Tu ne veux vraiment pas changer d'avis?"
"682","JOKE_4_MTX","Okay I guess. I mean it's cool for us, that's a lot of money, but I just want to be sure you're ok with this.","Ok, bon. C'est cool pour nous et tout, mais c'est vraiment beaucoup d'argent; je veux quand même être sûr que tu êtes ok avec ça."
"683","JOKE_4_NO_MTX","Oh okay... sorry. No need to be rude.","Bon d'accord... désolé. Pas besoin d'être vulgaire."
"684","JOKE_5_MTX","I have to say, you are determined to get that pack.","Tout de même, Tu es déterminé à acheter ce pack."
"685","JOKE_6_MTX","Heh, determination, that reminds me of Undertale.","Heh, détermination, ça me fait penser à Undertale."
"686","JOKE_7_MTX","Have you played that game? It's super cool, you should try it.","As-tu joué à ce jeu? C'est super cool, tu devrais l'essayer."
"687","JOKE_8_MTX","...and it's not even our game.  I mean Toby Fox is the guy who made it.  He's brilliant.","...et ce n'est même pas un de nos jeu. C'est Toby Fox le gars qui l'a fait. Il est génial."
"688","JOKE_9_MTX","I think he got inspired by Mother 3...  or is it Earthbound?","Je pense qu'il a été inspiré par Mother 3...  ou est-ce Earthbound?"
"689","JOKE_10_MTX","Hang on, is Earthbound and Mother 3 the same game? I never knew, I'm kinda confused by that.","Attend un peu.. Earthbound et Mother 3, c'est le même jeu? Et bien, je n'en savais rien, je comprend pas trop."
"690","JOKE_11_MTX","I think it's a lost in translation thing, kinda like Final Fantasy 6.... or 3. Whatever.","Je pense que c'est une affaire culturelle, un peu comme Final Fantasy 6... ou 3... Je sais plus."
"691","JOKE_12_MTX","Anyway I never played Earthbound.","De toute façon je n'ai jamais joué à Earthbound."
"692","JOKE_13_MTX","Yeah I know! It's lame right?","Oui je sais! Je suis une honte."
"693","JOKE_14_MTX","The thing is, I played it once when I was a kid, but I couldn't read English.","Chose étant, je l'ai joué une fois quand j'étais jeune, mais je ne comprenais l'anglais."
"694","JOKE_15_MTX","So you know, it was kinda hard to play an RPG when you couldn't understand anything on the screen.","Alors, ça rend les jeux de RPG plutot difficile quand tu ne pige rien de l'histoire... ou des menus."
"695","JOKE_16_MTX","I became good at English though!","Cependant, maintenant je le comprend!"
"696","JOKE_17_MTX","My mom was like 'Video games are useless!'","Ma mère me disais « les jeux vidéo c'est inutile! »"
"697","JOKE_18_MTX","But I showed her my English grades at school and she gave me a break.","Mais quand je lui ai montré mes notes d'anglais à l'école et elle m'a laissé tranquille."
"698","JOKE_19_MTX","My mom is so cool.","Ma mère est tellement cool."
"699","JOKE_20_MTX","I'm not afraid to say it, you know. I think it's cool to show her some love sometimes.","Je n'ai pas peur de le dire. Je pense que c'est cool de lui montrer un peu d'amour parfois."
"700","JOKE_21_MTX","You know, she makes sure you don't miss anything in your life. Food... a house, toys.","Elle s'assure que tu ne manques de rien dans ta vie. Nourriture... un toit, des jouets."
"701","JOKE_22_MTX","And we rarely get the chance to tell her that she is awesome.","Et nous avons rarement la chance de lui dire qu'elle est super."
"702","JOKE_23_MTX","Anyway! Where was I?","Bref, Où en étais-je?"
"703","JOKE_24_MTX","Ah yeah, that transaction.","Ah oui, cette transaction."
"704","JOKE_25_MTX","You know what? That little chat kinda made me feel better.","Tu sais quoi? Ce petit monologue m'a fait sentir un peu mieux."
"705","JOKE_26_MTX","It feels like you care about me.","J'ai l'impression que tu te soucies de moi."
"706","JOKE_27_MTX","Not only about those zombies, but about the developer behind it as well.","Pas juste à propos de ces zombies, mais aussi à propos de leur développeur."
"707","JOKE_28_MTX","That's a very cool feeling, thank you. :)","C'est un feeling très cool, merci. :)"
"708","JOKE_29_MTX","As a token of gratitude, I'll give you 5 diamonds. Do you want them?","En signe de gratitude, je vais te donner 5 diamants. Ça marche?"
"709","JOKE_30_YES_MTX","There! Thanks again for that little chat!","Voia! Merci encore pour ce petit moment!"
"710","JOKE_1_0_MTX","Hey! You're back!","Hé! Tu es de retour!"
"711","JOKE_1_1_MTX","I'm glad you're around again!","Je suis bien heureux que tu sois de retour!"
"712","JOKE_1_2_MTX","I have no diamonds left for you though.","Je n'ai plus de diamants pour toi par exemple. :("
"713","JOKE_1_3_MTX","Well, that's not very true... I'm the dev, so I could give you infinite diamonds if I want.","En fait, ce n'est pas exactement vrai... j'ai créé ce jeu, je pourrais théoriquement te donner des diamants à l'infini si je le voulais."
"714","JOKE_1_4_MTX","But that wouldnt't be fair for the other players.","Mais ça ne serait pas juste pour les autres."
"715","JOKE_1_5_MTX","Now I feel bad, because I just told you that I could, but I won't.","Maintenant je me sens mal de t'avoir dit que je pourrais mais que je ne le ferai pas."
"716","JOKE_1_6_MTX","What kind of friend am I?","Quel genre d'ami suis-je?"
"717","JOKE_1_7_MTX","It's kind of like if you tell your wife, 'Hey I could give you chocolate, but I won't'.","C'est un peu comme dire à sa femme, ""Hé je pourrais te donner des chocolats, mais non."""
"718","JOKE_1_8_MTX","That would be horrible.","Ça serait horrible."
"719","JOKE_1_9_MTX","I should buy chocolates for my wife...","Je devrais aller acheter des chocolats pour ma femme..."
