"679","JOKE_1_MTX","I mean, that's a ludicrous amount of money to pay for a virtual item, you still wanna buy that?","Ich meine, das ist eine absurde Menge an Geld, um ein virtuelles Item zu kaufen; willst du es immer noch kaufen?"

"682","JOKE_4_MTX","Okay I guess. I mean it's cool for us, that's a lot of money, but I just want to be sure you're ok with this.","Na gut, denke ich. Ich meine, für uns ist das kein Problem, das ist echt viel Geld. Ich will nur sicher gehen, dass es für dich okay ist."
"683","JOKE_4_NO_MTX","Oh okay... sorry. No need to be rude.","Ist ja schon gut... tut mir Leid. Kein Grund, unhöflich zu sein."
"684","JOKE_5_MTX","I have to say, you are determined to get that pack.","Ich muss zugeben, du bist ziemlich entschlossen, dieses Paket zu kaufen."
"685","JOKE_6_MTX","Heh, determination, that reminds me of Undertale.","Apropos Entschlossenheit, das erinnert mich stark an Undertale."
"686","JOKE_7_MTX","Have you played that game? It's super cool, you should try it.","Hast du das Spiel schon gespielt? Es ist unglaublich cool, du solltest es spielen."
"687","JOKE_8_MTX","...and it's not even our game.  I mean Toby Fox is the guy who made it.  He's brilliant.","...und es ist nicht einmal unser Spiel. Der brilliante Kopf dahinter heißt Toby Fox."
"688","JOKE_9_MTX","I think he got inspired by Mother 3...  or is it Earthbound?","Ich glaube, seine Inspiration kam von Mother 3... oder war es Earthbound?"
"689","JOKE_10_MTX","Hang on, is Earthbound and Mother 3 the same game? I never knew, I'm kinda confused by that.","Warte, ist Earthbound und Mother 3 nicht dasselbe Spiel? Ich bin mir da nie wirklich sicher, komme immer durcheinander."
"690","JOKE_11_MTX","I think it's a lost in translation thing, kinda like Final Fantasy 6.... or 3. Whatever.","Ich glaube, das ist während der Übersetzung verloren gegangen; wie bei Final Fantasy 6... oder 3. Oder so."
"691","JOKE_12_MTX","Anyway I never played Earthbound.","Wie auch immer, ich habe Earthbound nie gespielt."
"692","JOKE_13_MTX","Yeah I know! It's lame right?","Ja, ich weiß! Das ist echt lahm, oder?"
"693","JOKE_14_MTX","The thing is, I played it once when I was a kid, but I couldn't read English.","Die Sache ist, ich habe es als Kind mal gespielt, allerdings konnte ich damals kein Englisch."
"694","JOKE_15_MTX","So you know, it was kinda hard to play an RPG when you couldn't understand anything on the screen.","Nur, damit du es weißt, es war recht schwer, ein RPG zu spielen, wenn man kein einziges Wort auf dem Bildschirm versteht."
"695","JOKE_16_MTX","I became good at English though!","Aber mein Englisch hat sich enorm verbessert!"
"696","JOKE_17_MTX","My mom was like 'Video games are useless!'","Meine Mutter hat immer nur ""Videospiele sind Zeitverschwendung!"" gesagt."
"697","JOKE_18_MTX","But I showed her my English grades at school and she gave me a break.","Aber als ich ihr meine Englisch-Noten zeigte, ließ sie mich in Ruhe."
"698","JOKE_19_MTX","My mom is so cool.","Meine Mutter ist echt cool."
"699","JOKE_20_MTX","I'm not afraid to say it, you know. I think it's cool to show her some love sometimes.","Es ist mir auch nicht peinlich, das zu sagen. Ich denke, es ist cool, wenn man ihr etwas Zuneigung zeigt."
"700","JOKE_21_MTX","You know, she makes sure you don't miss anything in your life. Food... a house, toys.","Weißt du, sie stellt eben sicher, dass dir nichts im Leben fehlt. Essen... ein Zuhause, Spielsachen."
"701","JOKE_22_MTX","And we rarely get the chance to tell her that she is awesome.","Und wir bekommen nur selten die Chance, ihr zu sagen, wie großartig sie ist."
"702","JOKE_23_MTX","Anyway! Where was I?","Also. Wo war ich?"
"703","JOKE_24_MTX","Ah yeah, that transaction.","Ach ja, diese Transaktion."
"704","JOKE_25_MTX","You know what? That little chat kinda made me feel better.","Weißt du was? Diese kleine Unterhaltung hat mich glücklich gemacht."
"705","JOKE_26_MTX","It feels like you care about me.","Es fühlt sich so an, als würdest du dich um mich kümmern."
"706","JOKE_27_MTX","Not only about those zombies, but about the developer behind it as well.","Nicht nur um diese Zombies, nein, auch um den Entwickler hinter diesem Projekt."
"707","JOKE_28_MTX","That's a very cool feeling, thank you. :)","Das fühlt sich sehr schön an, dankeschön. :)"
"708","JOKE_29_MTX","As a token of gratitude, I'll give you 5 diamonds. Do you want them?","Als Zeichen meiner Dankbarkeit gebe ich dir 5 Diamanten. Möchtest du sie?"
"709","JOKE_30_YES_MTX","There! Thanks again for that little chat!","Hier! Und nochmals danke für die Unterhaltung!"
"710","JOKE_1_0_MTX","Hey! You're back!","Hey! Du bist wieder da!"
"711","JOKE_1_1_MTX","I'm glad you're around again!","Ich finde es schön, dass du wieder da bist!"
"712","JOKE_1_2_MTX","I have no diamonds left for you though.","Leider habe ich keine Diamanten mehr für dich übrig."
"713","JOKE_1_3_MTX","Well, that's not very true... I'm the dev, so I could give you infinite diamonds if I want.","Um ehrlich zu sein... das ist gelogen. Als Entwickler könnte ich dir unendlich Diamanten geben, wenn ich wollte."
"714","JOKE_1_4_MTX","But that wouldnt't be fair for the other players.","Doch das wäre den anderen Spielern gegenüber nicht fair."
"715","JOKE_1_5_MTX","Now I feel bad, because I just told you that I could, but I won't.","Jetzt fühle ich mich schlecht, weil ich dir gesagt habe, dass ich es könnte, aber es nicht tun werde."
"716","JOKE_1_6_MTX","What kind of friend am I?","Was für ein Freund bin ich denn?"
"717","JOKE_1_7_MTX","It's kind of like if you tell your wife, 'Hey I could give you chocolate, but I won't'.","Das ist fast, wie wenn man seiner Frau sagt, ""ich könnte dir Schokolade geben, aber mach ich nicht""."
"718","JOKE_1_8_MTX","That would be horrible.","Das wäre schrecklich."
