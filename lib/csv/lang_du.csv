"678","JOKE_0_NO_MTX","Ah ok, phew! I thought so!","Ah, ok√© - phew! Ik geloofde je bijna!"
"679","JOKE_1_MTX","I mean, that's a ludicrous amount of money to pay for a virtual item, you still wanna buy that?","Ik bedoel, dat is een belachelijk grote hoeveelheid geld voor een virtueel item. Wil je het nog steeds kopen?"

"683","JOKE_4_NO_MTX","Oh okay... sorry. No need to be rude.","Oh, ok√©... Sorry. Je hoeft niet onbeleefd te zijn."
"684","JOKE_5_MTX","I have to say, you are determined to get that pack.","Ik moet zeggen, je bent vastberaden om dat pack te krijgen."
"685","JOKE_6_MTX","Heh, determination, that reminds me of Undertale.","Heh, vastberadenheid, dat doet me aan Undertale denken."
"686","JOKE_7_MTX","Have you played that game? It's super cool, you should try it.","Heb je dat spel gespeeld? Het is super cool, je zou het moeten proberen. "
"687","JOKE_8_MTX","...and it's not even our game.  I mean Toby Fox is the guy who made it.  He's brilliant.","...en het is zelfs niet ons spel.  Ik bedoel, Toby Fox is de kerel die het maakte - Hij is briljant."
"688","JOKE_9_MTX","I think he got inspired by Mother 3...  or is it Earthbound?","Ik denk dat hij ge√Ønspireerd was door Mother 3...  of is het Earthbound?"
"689","JOKE_10_MTX","Hang on, is Earthbound and Mother 3 the same game? I never knew, I'm kinda confused by that.","Wacht, zijn Earthbound and Mother 3 dezelfde game? Nooit geweten. Ik ben nu verward."
"690","JOKE_11_MTX","I think it's a lost in translation thing, kinda like Final Fantasy 6.... or 3. Whatever.","Ik geloof dat het een 'lost-in-translation'-geval is, ongeveer als Final Fantasy 6... of 3..."
"691","JOKE_12_MTX","Anyway I never played Earthbound.","Hoe dan ook; Ik heb nooit Earthbound gespeeld."
"692","JOKE_13_MTX","Yeah I know! It's lame right?","Ja, weet ik! Zielig h√©?"
"693","JOKE_14_MTX","The thing is, I played it once when I was a kid, but I couldn't read English.","Nouja... Ik heb het ooit eens als kind gespeeld, maar toen kon ik nog geen Engels."
"694","JOKE_15_MTX","So you know, it was kinda hard to play an RPG when you couldn't understand anything on the screen.","Je snapt me wel, het was best wel moeilijk een RPG te spelen zonder dat je enig idee hebt van wat er gebeurt."
"695","JOKE_16_MTX","I became good at English though!","Ik werd echter goed in Engels!"
"696","JOKE_17_MTX","My mom was like 'Video games are useless!'","Mijn moeder zei altijd: ""Videogames zijn zinloos!"""
"697","JOKE_18_MTX","But I showed her my English grades at school and she gave me a break.","Toen liet ik haar mijn cijfers voor Engels zien, en toen hield ze op."
"698","JOKE_19_MTX","My mom is so cool.","Mijn moeder is zo cool."
"699","JOKE_20_MTX","I'm not afraid to say it, you know. I think it's cool to show her some love sometimes.","Ik ben niet bang om het te zeggen, weet je. Ik denk dat het eens cool zou zijn om onze liefde voor hun te uitten."
"700","JOKE_21_MTX","You know, she makes sure you don't miss anything in your life. Food... a house, toys.","Weet je, ze zorgen er wel voor dat je niets mist in je leven. Eten... Een huis, speelgoed..."
"701","JOKE_22_MTX","And we rarely get the chance to tell her that she is awesome.","En we krijgen zelden de kans om te zeggen dat ze zo geweldig zijn"
"702","JOKE_23_MTX","Anyway! Where was I?","Hoe dan ook! Waar was ik?"
"703","JOKE_24_MTX","Ah yeah, that transaction.","Ah ja, die transactie."
"704","JOKE_25_MTX","You know what? That little chat kinda made me feel better.","Weet je wat? Dat praatje zorgde er voor dat ik me wat beter voel."
"705","JOKE_26_MTX","It feels like you care about me.","Het voelt alsof je om me geeft."
"706","JOKE_27_MTX","Not only about those zombies, but about the developer behind it as well.","Niet alleen die zombies, maar ook de maker van die zombies."
"707","JOKE_28_MTX","That's a very cool feeling, thank you. :)","Dat is een zeer gaaf gevoel, bedankt :)"
"708","JOKE_29_MTX","As a token of gratitude, I'll give you 5 diamonds. Do you want them?","Als een teken van dankbaarheid geef ik je 5 diamanten.  Akkoord?"
"709","JOKE_30_YES_MTX","There! Thanks again for that little chat!","Astu! Nogmaals bedankt voor het praatje!"
"710","JOKE_1_0_MTX","Hey! You're back!","Hey! Je bent terug!"
"711","JOKE_1_1_MTX","I'm glad you're around again!","Ik ben blij dat je er weer bent!"
"712","JOKE_1_2_MTX","I have no diamonds left for you though.","Ik heb echter geen diamanten over."
"713","JOKE_1_3_MTX","Well, that's not very true... I'm the dev, so I could give you infinite diamonds if I want.","Nou ja... Ik ben de ontwerper van deze game, dus ik kan je oneindig veel diamanten geven, mocht ik dat willen."
"714","JOKE_1_4_MTX","But that wouldnt't be fair for the other players.","Maar dat zou oneerlijk zijn voor andere spelers."
"715","JOKE_1_5_MTX","Now I feel bad, because I just told you that I could, but I won't.","Nu voel ik me slecht, omdat ik zei dat het kan, maar ik het niet doe."
"716","JOKE_1_6_MTX","What kind of friend am I?","Wat voor soort vriend ben ik?"
"717","JOKE_1_7_MTX","It's kind of like if you tell your wife, 'Hey I could give you chocolate, but I won't'.","Het is alsof je tegen je vrouw zegt; ""Hey! Ik kan je chocolade geven, maar dat doe ik lekker niet!"""
"718","JOKE_1_8_MTX","That would be horrible.","Dat zou verschrikkelijk zijn."
"719","JOKE_1_9_MTX","I should buy chocolates for my wife...","Ik zou chocolade moeten kopen voor mijn vrouw..."
